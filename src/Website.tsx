       I built this website using React, HTML/CSS/JS on VSCode and 
       hosted it using Github Pages.
       I used ChatGPT to write starter code for styling, React router set up, 
       accessibility features, mobile responsivity, and minor debugging. No website content or personal
       information about me or my collaborators was inputted {" "}
