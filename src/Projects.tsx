            Our goal is to improve the quality of socially computing education taught in Brown University's
            Computer Science courses by building a dedicated pipeline from current sociotechnical research 
            to the CS classroom. 
            Simultaneously, we create opportunities for students to engage in research and product development, 
            receive mentorship from faculty, and practice leadership and teamwork skills.

            Science Technology and Society, Public Health, Religious Studies, Urban Studies, 
            Computational Biology, Data Science, Computer Science, and English. 
            All students working on the handbook are compensated through an independent
             study credit or pay. The handbook is supported by grants from the Public

          is a resource for non-profit organizations who are considering using an AI tool but are unclear
          about how to do so responsibly.
          The tree guides users through a series of questions and actionable steps
          that will help them progress towards adopting (or not adopting) the technology
